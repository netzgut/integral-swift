A collection of property wrappers we use to improve our iOS coding experience.

This is still WIP!

Services can loaded on injection (default), lazy or eager (on registry startup).

### Symbols

Injects key-based objects, e.g. configuration symbols.

### UserDefaults

Easy access to `UserDefault.standard`
